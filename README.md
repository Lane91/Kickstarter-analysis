# Kickstarter Challenge

## Overview of Project
### Purpose
This project is to help Louise understand how to create, manage, and execute the most effective and profitable theater campaign. In the effort to complete Louise's request we have analyzed the outcomes of multiple different theater campaigns based on their launch date, and their financial goals.



## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The following chart below gives a visual representation of successful, failed, and cancelled theater campaigns based on their launch date.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The following chart below gives a visual representation of the percentage of successful, failed, and canceled theater campaigns based on their financial goal.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
A challenge I encountered was when I was using the COUNTIFS notation and pulling information from other tables, I would forget to add in the $ sign, and when I copied that algorithm to the next column, I would get the wrong number because it was shifting columns on the table I was pulling from. To solve this, I simply went back through all of my algorithms and added back in the $ sign.

## Results

- Based on the launch date data we can conclude that the months of May, June, and July have the highest rate of success for theater-based events. We can also conclude that from September to December there is a higher rate of either failed or canceled theater events.

- Based on goals, on average the higher the cost of a theater event the greater the chance of that event failing. 

- The main limitation to this data is that we do not know the reason why one theater event was more successful than the other.

- We could create graphs comparing the success rate of the subcategories of theater, which are plays, musicals, and spaces.
